    "This Chatbot was released in 1966 (before the term Chatbot even existed) by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT. This was a revolutionary program that allowed humans to converse with a computer. As you may have predicted, this was a retrieval-based system, very different from the \"language models\" of today. However, you may be surprised by how well it performed despite the simplicity of the system. Here is part of a conversation someone had with ELIZA, from the original paper (the capitalised sentences are ELIZA's responses):\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Men are all alike.\\\n",
    "IN WHAT WAY\\\n",
    "They're always bugging us about something or other.\\\n",
    "CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE\\\n",
    "Well, my boyfriend made me come here.\\\n",
    "YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE\\\n",
    "He says i'm depressed much of the time.\\\n",
    "I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED\\\n",
    "It's true. I am unhappy.\\\n",
    "DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY\\\n",
    "......\n",
    "\n",
    "The program used certain programmed rules to \"transform\" the input into the output. In order to do this, the program must first decompose the sentence based on certain criteria and then reassemble it based on the predefined assembly specifications. For example, if it is provided with the input sentence, \"It seems that you hate me\", it may be decomposed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It seems that\n",
    "2) you\n",
    "3) hate\n",
    "4) me\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, (2) and (4) are recognised as key words. The program can then use the remaining sections of the sentence based on pre-defined rules to construct an output. For example, it may be programmed with the rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "decomposition template:\\\n",
    "(0 YOU 0 ME)\\\n",
    "and the reassembly rule:\\\n",
    "(WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I 3 YOU).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the \"0\" represents any number of words, whereas the \"3\" represents the 3rd part of the sentence from before. Hopefully, this makes the implementation a little clearer. If not, don't worry as you'll understand how it works once you start implementing your own version!\n",
